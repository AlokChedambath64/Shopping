# Shopping
Predicting whether a user visiting an online shopping website will make a purchase or not can be a valuable tool for tailoring the user experience. By understanding the user's intent, the website can personalize content, offer discounts, or provide additional assistance to potentially increase the likelihood of conversion. In this project, we'll build a nearest-neighbor classifier to predict user purchasing intent based on various features of their browsing session.

# Project Overview
The project consists of the following components:

Data Set: The provided data set (shopping.csv) contains information about approximately 12,000 user sessions on an online shopping website. Each row represents a user session, and the columns contain features such as the number of pages visited, duration of visit, browser type, region, traffic type, and whether a purchase was made.

Objective: The goal is to train a machine learning model to predict whether a user will make a purchase or not based on the given features. This will involve loading and preprocessing the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, training the model, making predictions, and evaluating the model's performance.

Evaluation Metrics: Instead of relying solely on overall accuracy, we'll measure the performance of our model using sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual positive cases (users who made a purchase) that were correctly identified, while specificity measures the proportion of actual negative cases (users who did not make a purchase) that were correctly identified.

# File Structure
The project directory contains the following files:

shopping.csv: The data set containing user session information.
shopping.py: The main Python script for loading data, training the model, making predictions, and evaluating performance.
README.md: This readme file providing an overview of the project.
# Dependencies
Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3
scikit-learn library (pip install scikit-learn)

# Usage
Run the following command to execute the project:

python shopping.py shopping.csv

# Implementation Details
load_data: This function loads the data from the provided CSV file, preprocesses it, and returns the evidence (features) and labels (purchase intent) as separate lists.

train_model: The function trains a k-nearest neighbor classifier (k=1) on the training data and returns the trained model.

evaluate: This function evaluates the performance of the trained model by computing sensitivity and specificity based on the predictions made on the testing data.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict user purchasing intent on an online shopping website. By understanding user behavior and utilizing predictive models, businesses can enhance the user experience and improve conversion rates.
